Evan Jensen is a lawyer and a technologist, also with an LLM in Innovation and Technology from Seattle University School of Law, and has been with RChain since the formation of the Cooperative.

Blockchain technology has come further in the last few years than almost anyone would have guessed, but it remains a nascent technology. Regulatory uncertainty, opposition from powerful interests, short-termist thinkers, there are many detractors as well as both regulatory and technical challenges that must be systematically overcome, one after another. But right now, we can begin to see the raw potential- we are truly starting to see the shape of things to come. Blockchain technology is applicable in countless ways from logistics and shipping, digitally signing and permanently recording documents, logs, records of all types, creating decentralized online marketplaces for products of all kinds, particularly digital products like ebooks, pictures, video, games, transfer of ownership, rights, a digital, permanent, trust-free approach obviates the need for well-financed middlemen in countless applications. Whether that is iTunes' 33% cut, Steam's 30% cut, widespread credit card fees, all can be made obsolete by not needing a trusted middleman any more. The result is a fairer and more egalitarian, without gatekeepers and controlling middlemen, a more equal and free market for the digital age. 

As I have said before, we should be under no illusions about the timeframe for the blockchain revolution- this will take years. As far as we have come, there is still much more that must be done before digital freedom and personal autonomy are the de facto standard baked into foundational technological architecture we use to conduct ourselves in the digital realm of the internet. This approach is a strong counter-argument to the abusive, corrupt, centralized powers like Facebook, who exert complete control over infrastructure used by billions, self-servingly exploiting their powerful position for their own gain. A decentralized Facebook where each person controls their own address within their own machine, sharing only at your own discretion, is no longer a pipe dream. Apply this same line of thought to financial independence. To smart homes. To democracy itself. The corrosive influences of consolidated power have had very real impacts on society in recent years. And it is vital that we stay focused and disciplined on the purpose, the goal, the reason for all of this effort in building a decentralized internet service that is controlled by, and serves people and not corporations. 

We have a long road ahead. I hope you agree with me, and support my re-election for director of RChain Cooperative once more. I will continue to serve as a director keeping the Cooperative focused on its primary mission, and representing the will of the members in choosing how to accomplish those goals.

Darryl's background is in music production, having worked on several Gold and Platinum Grammy nominated albums throughout his 30+ years in the industry.

His passion is in rooting out the middlemen in an industry infested with them—hence his interest in blockchain’s potential for creating alternative solutions for the artist/appreciator relationship.

Darryl has been involved with RChain from before its inception as an active member of the Synereo community beginning in early 2015.

Hello. My name is C.M. Macgowan and I have been an active RChain coop member since 2018. I have worked in finance on both the retail and institutional side for the past 15 years. I am a member of the Chartered Financial Analyst society and have an MBA with a concentration in finance. 

I believe the structure of the RChain's blockchain is revolutionary in a space of revolution. I also believe the development team is one of the most dedicated and hardworking groups I have encountered. 

When evaluating a project one needs to examine the individual ultimately calling the shots and determine if this individual is likely to fold when things get tough or passionately push forward despite adversity. I was interested in this project because of the revolutionary technology, but invested because of my belief in Greg Meredith's abilities and dedication. I have not been disappointed. 

I am a long-term investor and if elected to the board I will represent those that also believe for the project to become the most powerful and widely used smart contract platform we need to take steps to broaden awareness, grow the developer community, push the boundaries of our imagination as to how this revolutionary technology can change the world in a positive way, and keep the objectives of the dedicated, long-term investors in mind.  

My goal, as a member of the board, would be to use my financial and business management knowledge/experience to help the project over what I consider to be the make or break period of the project's life. If elected, I will be requesting the 1 year seat, as I believe after 12 months there will likely be a member with a better skill set to further assist the project along. I will also be requesting that my compensation related to my board seat be divided equally among the research team, not because I believe their compensation isn't fair, but to show my appreciation and support for what they have done and continue to do.

Thank you for your consideration.

C.M. Macgowan
