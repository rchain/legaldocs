Evan Jensen is a lawyer and a technologist, also with an LLM in Innovation and Technology from Seattle University School of Law, and has been with RChain since the formation of the Cooperative.

Blockchain technology has come further in the last few years than almost anyone would have guessed, but it remains a nascent technology. Regulatory uncertainty, opposition from powerful interests, short-termist thinkers, there are many detractors as well as both regulatory and technical challenges that must be systematically overcome, one after another. But right now, we can begin to see the raw potential- we are truly starting to see the shape of things to come. Blockchain technology is applicable in countless ways from logistics and shipping, digitally signing and permanently recording documents, logs, records of all types, creating decentralized online marketplaces for products of all kinds, particularly digital products like ebooks, pictures, video, games, transfer of ownership, rights, a digital, permanent, trust-free approach obviates the need for well-financed middlemen in countless applications. Whether that is iTunes' 33% cut, Steam's 30% cut, widespread credit card fees, all can be made obsolete by not needing a trusted middleman any more. The result is a fairer and more egalitarian, without gatekeepers and controlling middlemen, a more equal and free market for the digital age. 

As I have said before, we should be under no illusions about the timeframe for the blockchain revolution- this will take years. As far as we have come, there is still much more that must be done before digital freedom and personal autonomy are the de facto standard baked into foundational technological architecture we use to conduct ourselves in the digital realm of the internet. This approach is a strong counter-argument to the abusive, corrupt, centralized powers like Facebook, who exert complete control over infrastructure used by billions, self-servingly exploiting their powerful position for their own gain. A decentralized Facebook where each person controls their own address within their own machine, sharing only at your own discretion, is no longer a pipe dream. Apply this same line of thought to financial independence. To smart homes. To democracy itself. The corrosive influences of consolidated power have had very real impacts on society in recent years. And it is vital that we stay focused and disciplined on the purpose, the goal, the reason for all of this effort in building a decentralized internet service that is controlled by, and serves people and not corporations. 

We have a long road ahead. I hope you agree with me, and support my re-election for director of RChain Cooperative once more. I will continue to serve as a director keeping the Cooperative focused on its primary mission, and representing the will of the members in choosing how to accomplish those goals.

I have been involved with RChain from before its inception, being an active member of the Synereo community since 2015.

My background is in music production having worked on several Gold and Platinum Grammy nominated albums throughout my 30+ years in the industry. My passion lies in artist empowerment by rooting out the middlemen in an industry infested with them. 

After working for Resonate and RSong over the last few years, and currently as a contractor in Communications for RChain, I founded Emano.io, a music streaming social token network startup designed for the unique advantages of RChain’s technology for asset verification, tracking and provenance and the future evolution of NFT’s with data on chain! I believe that music is a major catalyst for network propagation and will play a key role in RChain’s usage as we reach block merge on main net later this year, and full decentralization in 2022.

I am also very passionate about RChain’s role in the social coordination required for humanity to work together for climate change mitigation.

During my time on the board, I was a strong advocate for creating our SPV entities, Daasl and RChain Publishing. I played an important role in developing  the “empowerment advertising” or “RAdvertising” concepts that became part of the Daasl whitepaper. 

After the hard forks, Dapp growth will be vital in 2022. 

2022 = Dapps, Dapps, Dapps!!!!!

Having recently returned with Greg and Atticbee from the AIM summit in Dubai, I am very excited about what 2022 has in store. The buzz about RChain is just starting to emerge and there is a lot of excitement in the air!

I am grateful for the Chinese community's engagement, energy and loyalty over the years and I will continue to work hard to do what I can to unite our communities better and to help bring RChain to the world.

My name is Fedir (Theo) Hallenius, also known as TheoXD.

I come from a game development background but fell in love with blockchain as I was learning Solidity to build my own sports betting platform. In late 2019 I worked for Enjin Coin as a plugin developer. I live in Sweden, born in Ukraine and can speak both Swedish and Russian.

A friend introduced me to RChain and it’s tech in January 2020 just in time for mainnet launch and I had the opportunity to run the first external validator node on mainnet. Shortly after I joined the Gov. Committee and served there for over a year now.

Currently I'm working at RPublishing, an RChain subsidiary where I help to develop a proof of concept of an NFT marketplace for Eve Arnold’s photo collection on top of Rchain.

I've learned a lot from the current board during the years with RChain and hope to learn more, and I hope to get to represent investors, validators, dapp/game developers and all co-op members in general

<img src="https://github.com/rchain/www.rchain.coop/raw/master/assets/leadership/Macgowan.jpg" width="300"> [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cmmacgowan)

Hello. My name is C.M. Macgowan and I have been an active RChain coop member since 2018. I have worked in finance on both the retail and institutional side for the past 15 years. I am a member of the Chartered Financial Analyst society and have an MBA with a concentration in finance. 

I believe the structure of the RChain's blockchain is revolutionary in a space of revolution. I also believe the development team is one of the most dedicated and hardworking groups I have encountered. 

When evaluating a project one needs to examine the individual ultimately calling the shots and determine if this individual is likely to fold when things get tough or passionately push forward despite adversity. I was interested in this project because of the revolutionary technology, but invested because of my belief in Greg Meredith's abilities and dedication. I have not been disappointed. 

I am a long-term investor and if elected to the board I will represent those that also believe for the project to become the most powerful and widely used smart contract platform we need to take steps to broaden awareness, grow the developer community, push the boundaries of our imagination as to how this revolutionary technology can change the world in a positive way, and keep the objectives of the dedicated, long-term investors in mind.  

My goal, as a member of the board, would be to use my financial and business management knowledge/experience to help the project over what I consider to be the make or break period of the project's life. If elected, I will be requesting the 1 year seat, as I believe after 12 months there will likely be a member with a better skill set to further assist the project along. I will also be requesting that my compensation related to my board seat be divided equally among the research team, not because I believe their compensation isn't fair, but to show my appreciation and support for what they have done and continue to do.

Thank you for your consideration.

#### MY VISION

I am an Theosophist &  Mystic. I have plenty of practical experience and also always learn knowledge directly from the masters of different factions. And always keep self-learning. This is why I can adapt well to different new changes. I focus on balancing the physical world and the spiritual world. I have kept meditating for as long as I can remember. I love Zen and Tao the most. I have studied many spiritual systems from different cultures around the world, and this is why I am good at integration. This is why I can deeply understand and trust RChain and Greg's visions, because those are my visions too.

The world is changing quickly, but much of it remains the same: laziness, ignorance, and fear are still with us; despite advances in technology. Unfortunately, technology cannot change people's greed. This is also the current state of the blockchain. The world needs to change, and human civilization is already facing another extinction crisis. Climate disasters and international wars are exacerbating... We need more and more people to become aware of it and unite. This time we need to seek a breakthrough for less conflicts, less differences, more transparent and efficient communication and cooperation in the global.

I have seen and experienced a lot of human inequality, suffering, and unrestrained selfishness. I have seen the worst and I have seen the best. I can tolerate ugliness, but I also aspire to beauty. All my vision is to make the blockchain and the real world really connect, welfare society, promote lower learning costs and enhance the economic development of countries, by people getting paid fairly and given more job opportunities. Global trade can also be faster, easier and more dynamic as a result, which allows people to learn more about each other's cultures, and a true global village is thus established.

I always thought that only when people no longer have to worry about clothes and food, then they will naturally begin to desire and learn about spiritual things. When more and more people do such things their frequency and that of the planet will rise. When people find inner peace, the world will no longer have wars and fratricide, and will no longer destroy nature without restraint. It is the only way we can keep racial peace and give back to this planet.

RChain is the fastest way I think we can achieve true large-scale concurrent blockchain technology and right now. I want to witness and accompany RChain through a simulation of borderless governance in the blockchain that will ultimately change the world.

I’m the founder of WeNode and TokenJar. I have 20 years of experience in high-tech and telecom. I got involved in crypto space in 2013.

As believers of RChain, we need to rebuild the confidence of the community and establish a healthy and workable governance structure. We need to get more people to join the community and contribute. We need concrete action to bridge the gap between a great mission and our advanced technology.

The Chinese community is a strong supporter of RChain. China has thousands of people who believe in RChain and Rholang technology. My mission is to get more Chinese involved in RChain’s ecosystem and to build a powerful Chinese community.

I'm intent to serve as a board member in the next 3 years.

Thank you so much,

Eric
