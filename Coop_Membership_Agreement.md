**COOP MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENT**

This Agreement is between The RChain Cooperative (“Coop”) and the
subscribing member (“Member”) to sign up as a voting member of the Coop.
In becoming a Coop member, Member Agrees to the following terms.

A.  ***Membership***

<!-- -->

1.  **Membership Fee**. Member agrees to pay the required nonrefundable
    membership fee of $20. In addition, in order for Member to maintain
    active status, Member agrees to purchase at least the equivalent of
    \$10 in Coop products or services each calendar year, or become
    inactive. In the event that Member’s account is inactive for a
    period of five consecutive years, the Member’s account will be
    terminated.

2.  **Member ID**. Member will be issued a Member ID. Each Member ID
    will be uniquely associated with that Member. Do not allow anyone
    else to use your Member ID.

3.  **Member Rebate**. Once a year, Member shall be eligible to receive
    an annual rebate of tokens expended during the previous year. The
    amount of tokens received in the rebate shall be proportional to the
    amount of Member’s tokens that Member has used to execute
    transactions which are tagged with their Member ID. Member will not
    under any circumstances receive more tokens than the amount of
    tokens used. Under no circumstances will any transaction not tagged
    with their Member ID be counted towards the Member’s rebate. The
    proportional amount of the rebate shall be set by the Directors of
    the Coop. To receive the rebate, Member will need to log in and
    claim their rebate. An unclaimed token rebate will expire one year
    after it is issued. An unclaimed token rebate must be claimed by
    Member, and not by a third party. However, after a rebate is claimed
    by Member the tokens may be freely used or transferred to others.

4.  **Membership Meetings**. If Member remains active, then Member is
    eligible to attend annual membership meetings of the Coop, and to
    attend any special membership meetings which may be called. At these
    membership meetings, the Member may vote on any matters before the
    membership, including the election of directors at the annual
    membership meeting. Active Members may also participate in the
    process of deciding which matters go up for vote. Members may
    propose matters of their interest to a vote before the membership;
    see the Coop’s bylaws and policies concerning the meetings of the
    members for more information.

5.  **Coop Committees**. If Member remains active, then Member is also
    eligible to serve on one of the Coop’s committees, subject to the
    selection processes used by each respective committee. The selection
    process will be voted upon by the Coop’s members. A Member may not
    vote for their own selection for a committee.

6.  **Membership is nonrefundable and nontransferable. **

        IMPUTED), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (EVEN IF THE

        EXCLUDE LIABILITY FOR THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD OR
        INTENTIONAL, WILLFUL OR RECKLESS MISCONDUCT OF THE COOP.

    c.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of

        some of the limitations of this Section 16 may not apply to you.

4.  ***Release***. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
    you release the Coop and the other Coop Parties from responsibility,
    liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential)
    of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not
    limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to
    disputes between participants in RChain and the acts or omissions of
    any third parties. \[You expressly waive any rights you may have
    under California Civil Code § 1542 as well as any other statute or
    common law principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of
    this release to include only those claims which you may know or
    suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this
    release.\]

5.  ***Dispute***.

    a.  ***Binding Arbitration***. Except for any disputes, claims,
        suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings
        (collectively, “Disputes”) in which either Party seeks to bring
        an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive
        or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of
        intellectual property, including, without limitation,
        copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or
        patents, you and the Coop (i) waive your and the Coop’s
        respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or
        related to these Terms resolved in a court, and (ii) waive your
        and the Coop’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you
        and the Coop will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration
        (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons
        charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and
        binding determination to resolve it instead of having the
        Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

    b.  ***No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative
        Actions***. Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms
        is personal to you and the Coop and will be resolved solely
        through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a
        class arbitration, class action or any other type of
        representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or
        arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute
        as a representative of another individual or group of
        individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or
        other type of representative action, whether within or outside
        of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of
        individuals.

    c.  ***Federal Arbitration Act***. The enforceability of this
        Section 18 will be both substantively and procedurally governed
        by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal
        Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), to the
        maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

    d.  ***Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution***. Each Party will
        notify the other Party in writing of any arbitrable or small
        claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so
        that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the
        Dispute informally. Notice to the Coop shall be sent by e-mail
        to the Coop at counsel@rchain.coop. Notice to you shall be by email
        to the email address you provide to us. Your notice must
        include (i) your name, postal address, email address and
        telephone number, (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the
        nature or basis of the Dispute, and (iii) the specific relief
        that you are seeking. If you and the Coop cannot agree how to
        resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date
        notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or
        the Coop may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section
        18, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent
        specifically provided for in Section 18(a), file a claim in
        court.

    e.  ***Process***. Any arbitration will occur in King County,
        Washington. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a
        single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial
        Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby
        incorporated by reference. The state and federal courts located
        in King County, Washington will have exclusive jurisdiction over
        any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may
        also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the
        county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to
        be heard in small claims court.

    f.  ***Authority of Arbitrator***. As limited by the FAA, these
        Terms, and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will
        have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all
        procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute,
        including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable,
        and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise
        be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator
        does not have the authority 9 to conduct a class arbitration or
        a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The
        arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may
        not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over
        any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over
        any proceeding involving more than one individual.

    g.  ***Rules of JAMS***. The rules of JAMS and additional
        information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By
        agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (i) acknowledge
        and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS,
        or (ii) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any
        claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for
        any reason.

6.  ***Governing Law and Venue***. These Terms will be governed by and
    construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of
    Washington, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles
    (whether of the state of Washington or any other jurisdiction) that
    would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
    Any Dispute between the Parties arising out or relating to these
    Terms that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small
    claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of the
    state of Washington and the United States, respectively, sitting in
    King County, Washington.

7.  ***Severability***. If any term, clause or provision of these Terms
    is held unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that term, clause or
    provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the
    validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term,
    clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these
    Terms.

8.  ***Miscellaneous***. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
    between you and us relating to your purchase of Tokens from us. We
    may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms. Our failure
    to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
    not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. We will not be
    liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under
    these Terms where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond
    our reasonable control. Purchasing Tokens from us does not create
    any form of partnership, joint venture, or any other similar
    relationship between you and us. Except as otherwise provided in
    herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of you and
    us and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights
    upon any other person or entity. You agree and acknowledge that all
    agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we
    provide to you, including these Terms, will be provided in
    electronic form.

Notwithstanding the above, the Member and the Coop shall each abide by
the RChain Cooperative Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.
